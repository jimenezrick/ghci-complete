- Use Vim 8.1 balloon to show types? :D
- Use a Vim 8 job to spawn the GHCi server.
- Can't get to generate the haddock info in the .hi files to use :doc
  inside ghci.

- build worker thread that does the GHCi work, clean interface with Vim
  to be more agnostic
- browse all at once, fetch info and cache, no batching from Vim. Or,
  single request and the response can have more=true:
    - It means more responses are coming
    - ghci is busy building partial responses and caching
    - response is adpative based in maxTime per partial response
