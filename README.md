# ghci-complete for Vim

Haskell code completion daemon based on ghcid with Vim support included.

## Motivation

I absolutely hate Vimscript. This is HDD (hate driven development),
becase Haskell is always better than anything else.

Also because:
- GHCi (and ghcid) are awesome
- Because UNIX and functional programming is about composing
- Simple is always better

## Useful info about GHCi
